# LeetCode
This repo record the process of solving the LeetCode questions.

- _2017.11.30:_ 008.String to Integer (atoi)
    - Don't underestimate the atoi(), need to consider many cases. Below was the definition.
    - The function first discards as many whitespace characters (as in isspace) as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many base-10 digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value. The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function. If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed and zero is returned.
- _2017.11.28:_ 003.Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
    - Learn Dynamic Programming method to solve Longest Common Subsequence and this one
- _2017.11.26:_ 003.Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
    - Learn the C++ STL, pair, map, set to solve this problem w/ sliding window bound
- _2017.11.21:_ 002.Add Two Numbers
    - Need to consider different length input and carry on
- _2017.11.20:_ 098.Validate Binary Search Tree
    - Two method, use min/max method has some bug. In Order Traversal will be much better.
- _2017.11.19:_ 728.Self Dividing Numbers
    - Weekly contest 59
- _2017.11.18:_ 004.Median Of Two Sorted Arrays
    - - Same idea as merge sort, merge two arrays and find the Median
